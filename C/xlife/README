		XLIFE -- a cellular-automaton laboratory

    This program will evolve patterns for John Horton Conway's game of Life.
It will also handle general cellular automata with the orthogonal and
nosymmetry neighborhood and up to 16 states (it's possible to recompile for
more states, but very expensive in memory).  Transition rules and sample
patterns are provided for the 8-state automaton of E. F. Codd, the Wireworld
automaton, and a whole class of `Prisoner's Dilemma' games, and many others.

    See the file HOW-TO-INSTALL for installation instructions.

    To use it, run `xlife'.  The help key is `?'.  There is a man page.

    The pattern library lives in the subdirectory `patterns'.  The
sub-subdirectory `life' contains an extensive library of interesting
Life patterns.  The sub-subdirectory `codd' contains transition rules
and components for the universal computer-constructor described in E.F
Codd's "Cellular Automata" Academic Press 1968 (ACM Monograph #3). The
sub-subdirectory `wireworld' contains patterns for the `Wireworld'
automaton described in the January 1990 issue of Scientific American
(Computer Recreations, p. 146).

    Some documents on advanced pattern creation and UCC components are in
the directory doc.

    We also include a couple of utilities:

    The `lifeconv' utility converts between different pattern file formats.
There is a man page. It may also collects separate included files into one
file that uses pattern blocks.
