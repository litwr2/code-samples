	Compilation requirements
Imake, GNU make, GNU C++ compiler, sed, and install are required.  Gawk is 
required for table2r conversion utility.  If your system is without gawk then 
remove or comment line with InstallScript command.  An optional development 
history diagram is generated by dot utility from graphviz package.


	Unpack sources


	Installation
Set up variables in Imakefile (see Variables chapter).  Check the path
variables carefully.  They should match your system.

As option place downloaded and other patterns to the `patterns' subdirectory.

Go to sources directory and run
    xmkmf
    make          #use gmake with BSD OSes
    make install  #may require administrator privilege

For uninstall run
    make uninstall


	Variables
The size of the internal hash is controlled by HASHBITS, e.g., the value 20 
(default) means 4/8 MB (32/64 bits) hash per pattern universe, 14 (the original
XLife default) -- 64/128 KB, 24 (will cover even the caterpillar pattern but 
excessive) -- 64/128 MB.

The variable LIFEDIR contains the name for the directory with the library
patterns.

Xlife default font is fixed width 9x15 from the X graphics.  However it
maybe changed by defining SMALLFONT variable.  This sets up font size to 8x13.

The variable VFREQ sets up framebuffer flush frequency in Hz.  Its value 0 
means to flush framebuffer after each step of the evolution.  Its default value 
is 50.
