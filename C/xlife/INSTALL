			XLIFE INSTALLATION NOTES

	This code uses ANSI prototypes.  If you're using an archaic UNIX with
pre-ANSI C, use GNU gcc to compile it.  GNU cc is almost certainly better than
your native compiler anyhow.

	You may want to modify the LIFEPATSDIR define in the Makefile to match
where you will be installing the xlife pattern libraries (you can also tell
the program about this through the LIFEPATH environment variable).

	Past that, not much needs to be done. Just compile and have
at some of the more interesting patterns shipped along with the
program; see doc/PATTERNS for a list.

	If you feel up to it, the HACKING file lists some things we would
like to add into the game ... if you implement any of these, please send
us the patches.

	About file formats - lifeconv is a filter that will switch life
file formats for you (see its manual page for details).  If you have the
patterns from the initial 1.0 release, you may want to run lifeconv on all
of the patterns.  It isn't really necessary since the new loader assumes the
old format if none is specified in the file (see the man page), but
lifeconv will convert the image to the smallest representation, and will
allow offset loading.
