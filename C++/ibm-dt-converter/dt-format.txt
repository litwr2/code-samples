003000.dat has two catalogs: for metadata and data.  Each catalog consists of file entries.  A metadata catalog starts at 0x1F5C00.  The sector size is equal to 1024.  Only entries marked by *-sign are used in the converter-program.

Each entry of the metadata catalog has the next fields:

offset	type 	value
0	int32	a constant 4
4	int32 	?
8	int16	a constant 0
A 	int32   a constant 0xAD0CDE5C
